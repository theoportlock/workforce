Workforce within workforce (edit a wf run command in a workforce window)
run nodeS function to just run a portion of the network that is selected
RUNNODES.py script for inspiration from gemini
don't change focus back to canvas on reload - messes up
scale the box with the font size not the zoom factor
clipboard issues - may just be wsl2
keep selected after running/reloading
Some other way of selecting like highlighting the nodes
zoom should be from the center of canvas
Shortcuts on all the buttons plus in help menu
design to disown on run 
Sort out the filelock for the gui
Fix initialization so that if there are edges that are 'to_run' then don't start from indegree=0
click and drag into canvas - wont work for wsl2 sadly but update anyway
bash updater button in node editos
shortcuts for mac, win and lin - i3 button press combination and windows shortcut
Connect shell button or keep separate?
output of command should be saved to the pipeline itself as a run log - can use tee also
Logging for dropdown on nodes (output of script + errors possibly separate)
undo-redo? use git?
pipeline diffs/shapshots/copy nodes
Keep nodes that have ran to ran (olin suggestion)
prefix suffix dropdowns and potential config files for running.
function builder with copy command to clipboard option?
