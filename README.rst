Installation
------------
Installation can be done with 

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install workforce

Running workforce
-----------------
To try a sample plan, run with:

.. code-block:: bash

   workforce example_plan.csv

To view the program graph, networkx and matplotlib are required. The -g flag is required to produce a dot file of the network:

.. code-block:: bash

   workforce -g example_plan.csv

To import and use in a python shell, use the following command:

.. code-block:: python

   from workforce.workforce import worker
   steve = worker("<PLAN.CSV>")
   steve.run()

Graph print
-----------
Converting the graph to a dot can be done using an online dot viewer or using Graphviz software with the example command:

.. code-block:: bash

   dot -Tpng -Kdot -o <DOT_FILENAME>.png <DOT_FILENAME>

.. image:: example_plan.png

The schema should be in the format of a csv with two columns. On the left and right column is the source and target command respectively (see example). Produces a logfile for each run.

Testing
-------
Testing can be done within this directory by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m unittest -v
